## Installation

1. Copy the `custom_components/alarm_clock` directory to your Home Assistant's `custom_components` directory
2. Restart Home Assistant
3. Add the configuration to your `configuration.yaml` (optional if using UI-only)
4. Add the custom card to your Lovelace dashboard
5. Enable HomeKit integration in Home Assistant if you want to use HomeKit features

### YAML Configuration (Optional)

If you want to configure some default alarms through YAML, add the following to your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
alarm_clock:
  alarms:
    - name: "Wake Up"
      time: "07:00"
      enabled: true
      repeat: true
      days:
        - mon
        - tue
        - wed
        - thu
        - fri
      skip_next: false

    - name: "Weekend Alarm"
      time: "09:00"
      enabled: true
      repeat: true
      days:
        - sat
        - sun
      skip_next: false
```

### HomeKit Integration

Each alarm will be exposed to HomeKit as a custom accessory that provides:

1. A switch to control whether to skip the next occurrence:
   - Turn OFF to skip the next alarm
   - Turn ON to enable the next alarm
2. Time control to set the alarm time directly from HomeKit:
   - Use the Home app or Siri to check the current alarm time
   - Change the alarm time using the Home app or Siri commands
   - Supports voice commands like "Set the bedroom alarm to 7 AM"

The switch will automatically reset to ON after the skipped alarm time has passed.

To use the HomeKit integration:

1. Make sure you have the HomeKit integration enabled in Home Assistant
2. Add the following to your HomeKit configuration in `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
homekit:
  filter:
    include_entities:
      - alarm_clock.wake_up # Replace with your alarm entity IDs
```

3. Restart Home Assistant
4. Add the accessory to your Apple Home app
5. Use the accessory to:
   - View the current alarm time
   - Modify the alarm time
   - Control whether the next alarm should be skipped

#### HomeKit Voice Commands

You can use Siri to control your alarms with commands like:

- "What time is the bedroom alarm set for?"
- "Set the bedroom alarm to 7:30 AM"
- "Skip the next bedroom alarm"
- "Enable the next bedroom alarm"

### Lovelace Card Configuration

3. Click "Edit Dashboard"
4. Click the "+" button to add a new card
5. Scroll to the bottom and click "Custom: Alarm Clock Card"
